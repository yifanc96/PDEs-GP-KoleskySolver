# PDEs-GP-KoleskySolver
Code for the paper [Sparse Cholesky Factorization for Solving Nonlinear PDEs via Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01294)

This code is built on the package https://github.com/f-t-s/KoLesky.jl

You can run the `.jl` files to see the performance of the algorithm for several nonlinear PDEs

The folder `screening_effect_demo` contains the notebook for demonstrating the screening effects
